# UM Project 2-1 Group 1: Adversarial Search and Reinforcement Learning agents for Dice Chess

This repository contains an implementation of a dice chess game that can be played by humans or with intelligent agents. 
This research delves into the application of adversarial search algorithms and reinforcement learning to create intelligent agents to play dice chess.
The primary algorithms implemented include MiniMax, ExpectiMiniMax and Q-Learning.

### Requirements:
- Java 10 (recommended) or older
- Gradle 7.0.1 or higher

## Application information
How to run our program :

After downloading the source code, open it in your favorite IDE. Then you have two options:<br /> 
- First option (the easiest one): Run it with Java 10 (You can download it here : https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-javase10-downloads.html ). Once you have Java 10, you set it as the project SDK and you can just run the Main class in src/main/java<br /> 
- Run it with a more recent java version : Then you can follow this tutorial (https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/)
